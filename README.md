# mac-m1-dpdklab
dpdk installation and testing on a MAC M1 with VMware Fusion 

# the "executive" summary 
the intent of this project is to help all the people compiling dpdk apps for testing purposes on a MAC M1 (arm64-based) laptop. Considering the huge limitation of M1's about not allowing nested VM's, the lab uses external VM's to push traffic into OVS-dpdk. 

# hardware and software setup 
1. Any MAC with arm64 cpu would fit, in this case i'm using a 2021 MacBook PRO.
2. macOS 14.4 Sonoma and VMware Fusion 13.5.2
3. the VM used in the lab: Ubuntu 24.4 ARM64 for both client and OVS host. 

# dpdk installation and packages 
Download the dpdk tar archive from [official dpdk.org link](https://core.dpdk.org/download/) preferring an LTS version
